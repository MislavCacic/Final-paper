In the final paper, an Android application for the cooperative creation and recommendation of
tourist sightseeing routes was designed and built, which was realized in the Android Studio. The
functionality of the application was realized using the programming language Kotlin, while the
descriptive language used for the design and appearance of the application was XML. The
TravelHelper application gives the user the ability to create a profile or register, add a new
landmark to the database, retrieve data for display, rate landmarks and create a route via Google
Maps. Through the rated sights, the user has the possibility to create a route according to the
ratings and recommendations of other users of the application and their own interests. The
examples show that the application is completely correct and functional in all functions. The goal
of the application is to make it easier for tourists to find content in a city that they are interested
in and would like to visit, and so that people who live in tourist places and from tourism can add
interesting things to their place and thus attract tourists to visit. Another goal of the mobile
application is to help the tourist in choosing the content he wants to visit during his stay in a
place.
